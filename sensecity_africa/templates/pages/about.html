        <p>
            {% blocktranslate %}In Africa, the digitalization process is happening
    faster and is more ubiquitous than one might expect. In fact, about a decade
    before payments through mobile phones became common in the North Atlantic,
    such technology was already available in several African countries, a famous
    example being MPesa in Kenya. Also, Internet connectivity is increasing
    rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa:
    <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx">with nearly 300 million internet users in 2019</a
    >, the Internet penetration rate in the region has not grown faster anywhere
    in the last decade, progressively closing the gap with the rest of the
    world. This development is mainly based on the growth of mobile telephony
    and telecommunication infrastructures - in 2019, nearly
    <a href="https://www.gsma.com/r/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Mobile-Internet-Connectivity-SSA-Fact-Sheet.pdf">790 million people in sub-Saharan Africa lived in an area covered by at
      least 3G signal</a
    >. Today, people may have access to a phone before they can access basic
    services such as safely managed water and sanitation.{% endblocktranslate %}

        <h2>{% translate "Potential applications in urban planning" %}</h2>
        <p>
            {% blocktranslate %}African cities are resilient by nature: for the many,
    dealing with limited resources and challenging environmental conditions is
    their routine, which results in largely "informal" social arrangements and
    spatial developments. However, current urban planning policies and tools
    often fail to address the significant portion of the urban population that
    lives in "informality". One of the main limitations is, indeed, access to
    reliable and updated data on all areas of the city, especially on informal
    settlements.{% endblocktranslate %}
        </p>
        <p>
            {% blocktranslate %}As digitalization seems to outpace the expansion of
    basic infrastructures and services, urban planners should reconsider, at
    this point, the role that digital technologies could play in the spatial
    development of African cities. As the latter go through drastically fast
    changes in their demography and morphology, they could certainly benefit
    from more dynamic monitoring tools based on mobile communication devices and
    crowdsourced data.{% endblocktranslate %}
        </p>
        <p>
            {% blocktranslate %}With recent advances in geospatial and communication
    technologies, virtually any connected citizen is now able to share their own
    urban experience - and thus "have a voice" - by providing both qualitative
    and quantitative data useful for urban planners. This opens the way for more
    participatory and inclusive planning practices that, by nature, rely on more
    plural and complete databases to inform decision-making.{% endblocktranslate

  <h2>{% translate "SenseCity Africa: crowdsourcing urban data" %}</h2>

  <p>
    {% blocktranslate %}SenseCity Africa explores the potential offered by
    communication technologies and the ubiquity of Internet access to address
    urban challenges in Africa. In this way, SenseCity displays urban data
    produced by "human sensors", in a process that Michael Goodchild has coined
    as
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10708-007-9111-y">"Volunteered Geographic Information" (VGI)</a
    >. This experiment builds on
    <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ceat/en/map4dev-maps-for-development-2/">previous works elaborated by the CEAT team</a
    >.{% endblocktranslate %}
</p>
<p>
{% blocktranslate %}The results of SenseCity will be materialized in the
    form of georeferenced images featuring qualitative attributes given by
    "tags", collected throughout the African continent. The preliminary outputs
    of this experiment will be presented at the
    <a href="https://seoulbiennale.org/teaser">2021 Seoul Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism</a
    >.{% endblocktranslate %}

<h1>{% translate "Contribute" %}</h1>
<p>
{% blocktranslate %}Everyone is entitled to contribute to the development of
    the database. Simply go to the <a href="{{ upload_url }}">"Upload"</a> tab
    and upload a photo of an African urban landscape. Please do not forget to
    add "tags" to your photo, suggesting how you perceive the place being
    photographed: for example, "bad traffic", "great view", "work", "home" or
    anything that comes up to your mind. For the sake of consistency, each
    contribution will be carefully examined before being published online.{%
